The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects and allows communication between the CPU, memory, and other hardware. Random Access Memory (RAM) serves as the computer\'s short-term memory, storing data that is actively being used by the CPU for quick access.The storage device, such as a hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), is where data is permanently stored, including the operating system, applications, and files. The power supply unit (PSU) provides the necessary electrical power to run the components. Graphics processing units (GPU), dedicated for rendering images and videos, are important for tasks like gaming, video editing, and machine learning. Additionally, input devices like keyboards and mice, and output devices like monitors and printers, enable users to interact with the system.
